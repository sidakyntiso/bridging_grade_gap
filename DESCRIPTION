Description: This package runs a Bayesian Aldrich Mckelvey model to correct bias in grade data. 
   To begin with, please input grading data as a CSV file. The file should contain one column 
   [labeled ta] that lists all graders. The remaining columns [grader1,grader2,..] should be 
   labeled by values corresponding to the levels of the first [ta] column.
